Situation:

    1) I have a local repository with an n amount of branches (none of them is named main).

    2) I've created a remote repository on GitHub and I want to connect it with my 
    local repository so I can upload to the remote repository what I've done in the local one. 

    3) Something to consider: The default branch created on GitHub is named main.
